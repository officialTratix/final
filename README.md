# webProgramming

What are the steps you followed?
     I cloned the repository, created and edited the files that needed to be done, added the new files, commited the changes for each file, and pushed each file.

Which tutorial did you follow?
     I already knew the commands to navigate the terminal from LABTECH. For the git commands, I used some tutorial from liquidweb.com. It was just the first result that came up. For cloning and adding, it came straight from githubs website.
